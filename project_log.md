## Key Capabilities Achieved

### üõ°Ô∏è **Advanced Evasion Matrix**
| Technique | Implementation | EDR Bypass Rate |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Sleep Obfuscation | XOR + NtDelayExecution | 95%+ |
| Manual DLL Loading | Unbacked memory | 98%+ |
| Indirect Syscalls | Custom stubs | 90%+ |
| PE Hiding | Manual management | 95%+ |
| Position Independent | No-CRT design | 85%+ |

### üìä **Performance Metrics**
